After reviewing the initial draft, I believe it has great potential, but there are a few areas that could benefit from additional refinement.\n\nFirstly, the section on market analysis could include more recent data. This would help substantiate the projected growth figures. Secondly, the financial breakdown could be expanded to include operational costs in detail.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to schedule a meeting to go over these changes in person. I am happy to assist in making this proposal the best it can be.\n\nThanks, Shahab.\n\nBest regards,\nAlice Johnson"
